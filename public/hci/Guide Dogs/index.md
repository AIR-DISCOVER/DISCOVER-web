In 2020, China has the second largest population of vision-impaired people in the world, with over 17 million individuals visually disabled. Because of the difficulty and prohibitive cost of travel, many blind people are deprived of the same opportunities as sighted people to get around. Guide dogs are the most "intelligent" form of commercial mobility aids available to the visually impaired. A guide dog can remember routes, navigate for the blind, obey commands, and help to avoid obstacles and oncoming traffic. Because of the late development of dog training techniques and large groups of visually impaired people, guide dogs are still not popular in China. Moreover, many blind people have given up this method because they are unable to care for their dogs independently.

To address the mobility difficulties of the blind, our team seeks to replicate and enhance the advantages and remedy the disadvantages of guide dogs through the use of artificial intelligence and robotics. For example, we use autonomous driving technology to achieve door-to-door navigation and accurate obstacle avoidance in complex road conditions, machine learning to solve the challenges of visual recognition, demonstrative teaching and voice recognition, and natural human-robot interaction technology to tackle the issue of efficient communication and collaboration between users and robot guide dogs. In addition to accuracy and efficiency, our team uses user experience research and human-machine ergonomics experiments to reduce the cognitive load of the blind and improve the long-term comfort of use. Through user feedback and participatory design, we will precisely solve the pain points and design interaction modes that are suitable for visually impaired travelers; finally, we will achieve the optimization of the efficiency and experience of collaborative mobility between blind people and robots.
