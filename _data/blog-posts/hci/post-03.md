> "The body expresses and influences our minds."

This project aims to obtain human physiological data and the somatization performance of emotions through the intelligent wearable system. We intend to help people improve self-perception of both physical and psychological states with interactive feedback.

Given the fundamental role of cloth's relationship with humans, we hypothesize that the physiological data gathering by the wearable system may be used as a resource for human emotional understanding. The concept of intelligent clothing may provide a valuable link between physical hardware, somatization performance, and human emotions. For this purpose, an innovative wearable sensing platform is currently being set up, focusing on capturing physiological data with a multimodal sensing method. 

Moreover, on the issue of emotion management/regulation, structural interviews with psychological counselors have been conducted and analyzed with the open-coding method. Based on insights from interviews, we focused our attention on the regulation of body perception enhancement, and incentive feedback provides.
