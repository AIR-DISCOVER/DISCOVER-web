## "I am the follower, also the boss": Exploring Different Levels of Autonomy and Machine Forms of Guiding Robots for the Visually Impaired
category: Human-Computer Interaction

Guiding robots based on autonomous driving technology can help blind and low-vision people gain the ability to travel independently. In this study, two forms of robots with switchable autonomy (guiding cane and car) were designed and a controlled study in the laboratory and a field study in a real environment were conducted. The findings of this research provide evidence from empirical studies on the use of different machine forms and autonomy by visually impaired people, and these could provide inspiring references for the design of assistive robots.
