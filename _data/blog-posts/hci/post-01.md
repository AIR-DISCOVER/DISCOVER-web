This project aims to obtain human physiological data and the somatization performance of human emotions through the intelligent wearable system. We intend to help people improve self-perception of both physical and psychological states with interactive feedbacks.

Given the fundamental role of the relationship between clothes and humans, we hypothesize that the physiological data gathered by the wearable system may be used as an effective resource for human emotional understanding. The concept of intelligent clothing may provide a valuable linkage between physical hardware, somatization performance, and human emotions. For this purpose, an innovative wearable sensing platform is currently being set up, focusing on capturing physiological data with a multimodal sensing method.


Moreover, on the issue of emotion management/regulation, structural interviews with psychological counselors have been conducted and analyzed using the open-coding method. With the help of insights gathered from interviews, we have then focused on the regulation of body perception enhancement and incentive feedback.
