With the mass adoption of artificial intelligence in vehicle automation, autonomous driving technologies are experiencing rapid development from hardware, software, system engineering, and social policies. As automation increases, the relationship between human drivers and intelligent vehicles is gradually changing. The autonomous vehicle overtook the human driver in action speed, computation, replication, and sensory ability. The human driver overtook automation in the capacity of policy and ethical understanding, induction, and improvisation. The collaboration between humans and technological systems will bring more safe and efficient driving experience. This study aims to investigate how human drivers and autonomous vehicle AI systems interplay and influence each other and design advanced human-automation interaction systems for safer and more efficient and effective human-vehicle cooperation.
