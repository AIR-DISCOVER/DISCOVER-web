AIR, together with QMAN and QIANZHI, has launched the world's first AI personalized building block product - "Brick Studio". Based on the input image, it can a design personalized anthropoid block model which is named Fangzai. The personalized design of Fangzai could be promoted on a large scale and delivered timely through flexible productions. Such application and delivery are further enlarged and accelerated with AI technology, offering customers novel, engaging, and joyful product experiences.

Fangzai Brick Studio is an intelligent machine which can automatically convert the captured portrait into a physical gadget made up of LEGO bricks. On the contrary to synthe- sising a 2D image or a virtual 3D object, generating physical 3D assembly object needs to take physical properties and assembly process into consideration, leading to more challenges. To generate brick models for arbitrary portraits, we formulate the transformation between the attribute space (extracted from 2D images) and the brick model space as a constraint integer programming problem which can be solved with a heuristic search method. Furthermore, as the bricks are physically scattered, we propose an algorithm to generate corresponding assembly instructions for customized figure-featured-bricks to facilitate users' assembly. Meanwhile, we deploy the proposed algorithms on an automatic machine which integrates a camera, a printer, a laptop, and a brick operation unit. Finally, the generated brick models and assembly instructions are evaluated by a large number of users. It is worth noting that the whole system works as an intelligent vending machine, producing a 150-brick-model within 3 minutes.
