With the development of autonomous driving technologies, companies such as Waymo, Tesla, and Baidu are continually increasing their investment in large-scale autonomous vehicle tests and demonstration applications, aiming to facilitate future commercial operations in the area of driverless cars. However, the global development of autonomous driving technology still remains in its early stage. On one hand, there is still limited market space and small-scale application of Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation) autonomous vehicles even when they are already proceeding into the commercial stage. The development of upper-level automation such as Level 3 and Level 4, on the other, is mainly focused on driving tests and regional demonstrations. In all, the operation scenarios remain to be explored.

It is hard to reduce the rate of accidents with autonomous vehicle perception sensing and its follow-up decisions. Moreover, the uncertainties in the real-world environments should hardly be ignored by vehicle perception, especially for some corner cases. Hence, our project aims to build a high-photorealistic rendering simulation platform for autonomous driving and digital twin system based on real traffic data, with which we may simulate the testing environment, train the model, and test the V2I for pedestrian safety protection. We intend to explore safe, extensive, economical, and efficient solutions and implementation of autonomous driving technology . Hopefully, we are going to help achieve the commercialization of autonomous driving on a large scale as soon as possible.
