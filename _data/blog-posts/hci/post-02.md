Physiological data refers to any data that has been collected from the physical body or its systems, e.g., electrocardiogram or ECG/EKG signal, respiratory rate, electrodermal activity or EDA signal, electromyography or EMG signal, electroencephalography, or EEG signal. It is the underlying response expressed when a person is subjected to certain stimuli.

Currently, physiological sensing is promised to have wide application prospects in healthcare, smart home, autonomous driving, digital entertainment and other areas. By assessing the physiological signals of the user, the intelligent system can infer the user's emotional state, cognitive load, attention level and behavioral intentions. Our study aims to investigate multimodal physiological computing, enhance the perception of the machine to humans, promote system autonomy and thus improve the efficiency of human-AI collaboration.
