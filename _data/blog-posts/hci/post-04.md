The auto industry is undergoing changes that are unseen in a century. Autonomous vehicles are developing rapidly around the world. The companies such as Waymo, Tesla, and Baidu are continually increasing their investment in large-scale autonomous vehicle tests and demonstration applications in order to facilitate future commercial operations in the area of driverless cars. However, the global development of autonomous driving technology is still in the early stages. Even the Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation) autonomous vehicles are in the commercial stage, but there is still limited market space and small-scale application. The development of upper-level automation such as Level 3 and Level 4 is focused on driving tests and regional demonstrations. Nonetheless, the operation scenarios remain to be explored.

It is hard to reduce the rate of accidents by autonomous vehicle perception sensing and its follow-up decision. Moreover, the uncertainties in the real-world environment can hardly be ignored by the vehicle perception, especially for some corner cases. This project aims to build a high photorealistic rendering autonomous driving simulation platform and digital twin system that is based on the real traffic data to simulate the testing environment, train the model, and test the V2I for pedestrian safety protection. We intend to explore safe, extensive, economical, and efficient autonomous driving technology solutions and implementation. We are dedicated to helping achieve the commercialization of autonomous driving on a large scale as soon as possible.
