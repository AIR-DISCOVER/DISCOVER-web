Music therapy is the clinical use of music within therapeutic progress to improve the physical, psychological, and social well-being of individuals. It involves a broad range of interactive music activities, such as listening to music, singing, and interacting with musical instruments. Mental health conditions are increasing worldwide, especially under the impact of COVID-19, the global prevalence of mental health issues has massively increased. To address mental well-being, we have decided to explore the use of AI-powered music to engage active listening and interactive music activities. Specifically, we research on 1), how to use AI-generated music to support music therapists during the treatment process; 2), Lego-based musical instrument design for facilitating the treatment process of interactive music therapy.
