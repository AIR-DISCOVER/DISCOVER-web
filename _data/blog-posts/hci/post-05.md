Physiological data refers to any data that is collected from the physical body or its systems, e.g., electrocardiogram or ECG/EKG signal, respiratory rate and content, electrodermal activity or EDA signal, electromyography or EMG signal, electroencephalography or EEG signal. It is the underlying responses expressed when a person is subjected to certain stimuli. Currently, physiological sensing is promised to have wide application prospects in healthcare, smart home, autonomous driving, digital entertainment, and so on. By assessing the user's physiological signals, the intelligent system can infer the user's emotional state, cognitive load, attention level, and behavioral intentions. This study aims to investigate multimodal physiological computing, enhance the perception of the machine to humans, promote system autonomy and improve the efficiency of human-AI collaboration.
