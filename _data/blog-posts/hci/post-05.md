WHO has defined the term "social and emotional skills" as "the abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life," indicating the important role of both emotional awareness and regulation in one's life.


According to nowadays researches, emotional education can be most effective when started as early as possible from early childhood. When it comes to young children, we must consider what kind of materials could best support them when learning emotions. Due to the opportunity that pretend play has provided for emotional experience and expression, it is feasible that it is a mode for socio-affective development, research in developmental psychology has observed a unique relationship between pretend play and general emotional development. In light of this, we intend to design an educational pretend play kit for pre-schoolers ' emotional education.


When talking about emotion regulation, sometimes it seems to imply that children should suppress emotional expression. However, this is not the case. Based on Gross' process model, emotion regulation is goal-oriented and consists of five stages: the selection of situation, the modification of situation, the deployment of attention, the change of cognitions, and the modulation of responses. By skillfully combining these five stages with pretend play, we hope to help children better learn and regulate their emotions.
