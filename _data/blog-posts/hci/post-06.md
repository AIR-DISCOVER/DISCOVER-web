This research presents a customized programmable robotic system, TanTwin (Tangible Twin), which is designed to promote STEM education for K-12 children.

Firstly, TanTwin is implemented through a wheel-robot with standard LEGO bricks. With several deep neural networks, a child can convert a captured portrait of himself/herself into standard LEGO bricks and thus build a tangible twin robot of himself/herself automatically. Besides, in adaption to the customized appearance, the corresponding visual elements and content of the robotic system have been changed by a rule-based adaption algorithm.


To demonstrate the effectiveness of TanTwin and investigate whether tangible twin robots could contribute to children's learning, we have conducted a controlled experimental study to compare the learning with a TanTwin and that with a standard robot system by measuring students' cognitive learning outcomes. The pre-/post- knowledge test results have indicated that learning with a tangible twin robot leads to significantly better learning outcomes. Given these results above, we have validated our system and always hold the belief that customization technology can promote STEM education.
