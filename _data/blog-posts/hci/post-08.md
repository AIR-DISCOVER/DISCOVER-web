Creativity education is of great significance for children and teenagers. Therefore, how to assist creativity education from the perspective of human-computer interaction has become an important direction for the cross-study of human-computer interaction and creativity psychology. Noticeably, the research on creativity support tools that has been based on augmented reality has attracted more and more attention in recent years.

Building games with building blocks can effectively promote the development of creativity of young children. Through building games, children can exercise their skills of spatial imagination and story-creation. However, it is not easy to build scenes with building blocks, and since the construction of an exquisite scene requires a lot of time and energy, it is not conducive to the development of children's divergent thinking to some extent, especially when divergent thinking serves as an important mental ability of creativity.

The theme of our study is an augmented, reality-based building block product for creativity education, which hopes to reduce the difficulty of scene building games and promote the development of children's divergent thinking through virtual-real integration.
