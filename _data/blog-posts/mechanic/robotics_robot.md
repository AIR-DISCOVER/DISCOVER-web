The robotic industry has gained boosting prosperity in recent years. The traditional wheeled and legged robots 
have been proved to be insufficient to be with either trafficability or efficiency of mobility. Therefore, 
the multimodal locomotion of wheel-legged robots has become increasingly popular since it could take advantage 
of both models. Our group has finished a prototype of a wheel-legged robot which supports two moving modes and 
is capable of conducting missions with a lightweight robotic arm. Meanwhile, we have also been working on the 
simulation and Sim2Real transfer. Our group aims at developing a multimodal robotic platform for mobile manipulation, 
which individually or collaboratively provides real accessibility for users and reliability in conducting missions 
anywhere requested. Our goal is to provide a fundamental robotic platform in both algorithm and hardware design.
