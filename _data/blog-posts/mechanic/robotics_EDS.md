Enabling large-scale resource utilization is supposed to be the critical part of the next step of civilization, especially in outer space. The concept of the Exponential Deep Space system is originated from the [idea](http://exponentialdeepspace.org/) in 2018, which takes the ability of In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) with M type asteroids to enable the fast exponential growth of industrial volume in outer space. It has been a long-term project for further technology development in need of sensing, robotics, advanced manufacture, space thrusting, etc. With the help of intelligence, it plays a critical role in resource exploration and further ISRU. In DISCOVER, our group develops intelligence for autonomous systems and advanced manufacturing to prepare for the coming future.
