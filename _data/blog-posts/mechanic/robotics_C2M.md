Consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) is a model connecting manufacturers directly with consumers, 
which removes logistics, inventory, sales, distribution, and other intermediaries and 
thus enables consumers to buy high-quality and low-price products. The new paradigm of C2M 
is equivalent to product-level Industry 4.0, an interdisciplinary research area of robotics 
(computer-aided manufacturing) and computer graphics (computer-aided design) that represents 
major social progress, satisfies individual needs and improves production resource utilization. 
We start from building C2M systems, applying them in simple products such as LEGO bricks and clothes. 
Meanwhile, we are also interested in several critical manufacturing processes, such as appearance coloring, 
defect detection, and flexible assembly. Moreover, we have been working on C2M architecture design and 
system simulation to define and verify the fundamental rules for complicated multi-robot and 
multi-human collaboration, both of which may help optimize the end-to-end system performance.
