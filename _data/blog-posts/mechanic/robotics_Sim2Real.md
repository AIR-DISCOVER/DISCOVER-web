In the research area of robotics, there exists a huge gap between academia and industry. There are mainly two bottlenecks: 
(1) it costs too much to conduct large-scale robotic system tests for academia to examine the generalization capability of 
robotic algorithms, and (2) the evaluation criteria of robotics is not aligned between academia and industry due to the high 
dependency on robot hardware configuration. Therefore, we hope to bridge this gap and the first step we have taken is hosting 
the RoboMaster University Sim2Real Challenge at ICRA2022. Our group aims to build a cloud-based robotic sim2real platform 
where we may solve such problems by investigating simulation-to-reality gaps and performing explainable domain transfer learning 
which is supposed to shorten deployment duration in robotics. We hope to attract researchers around the world to make use of 
our platform and contribute to Sim2Real-based robotics, after which the research progress in robotics could hopefully be accelerated.
