## Transportation Area
DISCOVER Lab intends to define future transportation from the following aspects: 

System-level paradigm shifting
- leveraging from 3-dimensional transportation
- leveraging from smart infrastructure
- leveraging from simulation-to-reality transfer 

Core technology breakthrough: 
- developing next-gen all-terrain locomotion
- developing next-gen city-scale SLAM
- developing next-gen 3D scene understanding

Since its inception in 2021, DISCOVER Lab participated in [**VICAD (Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving) Whitepaper**](/transportation_book.pdf) with Baidu Apollo in 2021 and 2022 sequentially, hold [**RoboMaster University Sim2Real Challenge**](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/robomaster/sim2real_icra22.html) at ICRA2022, and worked on a [**Unified Open Simulator** ]() (coming soon) and [**Open Software for 3D Scene Understanding** ](https://github.com/OPEN-AIR-SUN).
