## Transportation Area

Since its inception in 2021, DISCOVER Lab participated in **VICAD (Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving) whitepaper** (link) with Baidu Apollo in 2021 and 2022 sequentially, hold **RoboMaster University Sim2Real Challenge** (link) at ICRA2022, and worked on a **unified open simulator** (coming soon) and **open software for 3D scene understanding** ([https://github.com/OPEN-AIR-SUN](https://github.com/OPEN-AIR-SUN)).

DISCOVER Lab intends to define future transportation from the following aspects: 

System-level paradigm shifting: 
- leveraging from 3-dimensional transportation
- leveraging from smart infrastructure
- leveraging from simulation-to-reality transfer 

Core technology breakthrough: 
- developing next-gen all-terrain locomotion
- developing next-gen city-scale SLAM
- developing next-gen 3D scene understanding
