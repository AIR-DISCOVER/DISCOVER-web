- From images to the physical world; \
- From images to our brains. \
We believe a methodology that integrates data-driven recognition and closed-form reconstruction would lead to a comprehensive understanding of the world, facilitating emerging AI-empowered robotics applications that collaborate with people. \
\
AIR DISCOVER HCI Team is a Human-centered AI research team that focuses on creating AI-driven systems that amplify and augment human abilities and well-beingï¼š\
- Understanding and modeling long-term human behaviors and emotions in the real world through wearable or ubiquitous contactless sensors; \
- Building novelty human-in-the-loop AI/Robotics systems; \
- Exploring methods and algorithms enabling effective human-AI collaboration that make human partnerships more productive, creative, accessible, and enjoyable.\
\
AIR DISCOVER Hardware Lab aims to fulfill the requirement of robotics research in AIR, especially to unleash the potential of novel sensor/actuator systems for the mobility of robots and 3D printing for various rapid material forming. ";
