        <p>
            AIR-SUN（Scene UNderstanding）is the computer vision group of DISCOVER. Computer vision is the art of tracing light, along two paths:<br />
            <br />
            A. From images to the physical world.<br />
            B. From images to our brains.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe a methodology that integrates data-driven recognition and closed-form reconstruction would lead to a comprehensive understanding of the world, facilitating emerging AI-empowered robotics applications that collaborate with people.
